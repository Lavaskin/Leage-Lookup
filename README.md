# League Lookup

This is a basic League of Legends utility app. You can look up champions and view their stats given current version information pulled from Riots servers.

The app was rebranded and the UI was touched up for release on Google's Play Store by Jackson Eggers (@lavaskin). Originally a school project for CS 492 @ Oregon State University.
